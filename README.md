# README

This readme contains my notes and explains some of my thought processes regarding the exercise.

A brief introduction outlines the purpose, establishes some assumptions about the reader's abilities and notes the use of vanilla JavaScript in the code examples. I opted not to use a front-end framework or third-party library (i.e. Axios) because the goal is straightforward, and I wanted the output file to be self-contained and lean.

In the `About the Petstore API`, I introduce the API and identify critical technical points that a consumer of an API would find helpful. Had the task required one of the authenticated endpoints, I would have added an authentication guide too.

This section also includes a detailed guide on using the findByStatus. It describes the query parameters and provides example request and response examples. I like separating endpoint descriptions from tutorials so they can serve as a standalone, language-agnostic reference. You'll note I included cURL in my request because cURL is the lowest common denominator (everyone has it) and has no levels of abstraction. Similarly, I included the raw JSON response to illustrate what a developer can expect to receive upon a successful request. I would have documented those for completeness if the API included error responses.

In the `Building the HTML pet store` section, I walk the reader through building a basic page, querying the data and rendering out the list.

This section puts into practice what they've learnt in the API guide (`About the Petstore API`) and combines this with their assumed HTML/JavaScript and REST API knowledge. Because of their assumed knowledge, I didn't go into tremendous detail, only highlighting essential information like the requirement to handle the Promises returned by Fetch, which might throw developers used to working in Axios or a front-end framework that abstracts them away.

Note that I haven't styled the output as CSS wasn't a listed requirement, and I didn't think it necessary. I only rendered the `name` field because it was the API's only consistently helpful bit of data.

I've kept the tone deliberately conversational and informal, per the brief and my preferred style, because I think it improves a reader's retention and makes the document more approachable.

For the sake of completeness, I've added a `Next steps` section to serve as a concluding statement, call to action and a pointer to further reading.
